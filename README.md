# connecting

to connect the keyboard, all you have to do is turn on your hub with the hub code in memory(you can just run it with the pybricks app once, it will stay on the hub until another change even after being shut down), and launch the pc program. if everything went well, there should be "connected!" in the console.

# using it and tweaking

to use it, just press the green button on the hub after connecting it to your pc to turn on/off. now you can type stuff using it.

 there is a 300ms delay after each keypress, but you can change that to your liking(the amount of milliseconds is stored in the "delay" variable in the hub code). also, you could tweak the colorcodes(the "O" and "I" variables in the hub code) if you dont have the necessary colored lego pieces/if it isnt accurate for you. after you are done typing, it will copy the hub's console output, and types it as your keyboard. after it has done typing the line, it will press enter and go to another line/send the file depending on where you're writing this in.
